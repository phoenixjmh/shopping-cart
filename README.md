## Create a new project with at least two pages 
  > (a homepage and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart).Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both routes.

## On your shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart. 
  > You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).


## Build individual card items for each of your products.  
  > Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
