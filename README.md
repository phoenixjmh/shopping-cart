## Create a new project with at least two pages 
  > (a homepage and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart).Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both routes.

## On your shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart. 
  > You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).


## Build individual card items for each of your products.  
  > Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.

# This App

> A website created with React that uses the reverb API to gather music gear sale listings, posing as local listings in my imposter store "Tone Depot".

  
### Dynamic Cart
#### The user's cart will keep it's total price accurate, and the item count accurate when either a new item is added to the cart, or an existing item has it's number in the cart increased

> When an item already in the cart has it's amount increased, a duplicate of that item is added to the cart again.  
> Since the cart is dynamic, this would create another duplicate of the displayed item (instead of increasing the number of this item, it would simply append the item to the cart again, creating a duplicate card item).
